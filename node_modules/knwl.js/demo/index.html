I'm sorry, I'm extremely busy right now. I just looked at the clock, and it's 12:54 AM, I've still got a lot of work to do.  Don't worry about the event tomorrow, it's been moved ahead a week, the 28th of December. Remember though, you've got to call to get a ticket soon, their # is 212-323-1239 and their based in Los Angeles, or call the toll free number 1 800 567-4321. Their website says it costs $23 per person.
If you've got enough time, they have some more information on their website, http://theevent.com. Also checkout some comments at #coolevent.
